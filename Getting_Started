Meeting with Shivam (03/03/25)

- Need access TeraLab
- Understand VCF File
- In lab server, find Codigo dataset, create a subset of that dataset that can be used for analysis for medical samples
- Ask Jordan for access to lab server and what subset he wants (what variants he wants and what samples he wants)
