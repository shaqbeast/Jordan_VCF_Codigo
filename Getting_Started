Meeting with Shivam (03/03/25)

Things completed:
- Understanding VCF Files (could you probably send a recorded lecture from 6150?)
- Creating github
- Creating dropbox account 
- Have access to TeraLab (I think?)

Things I need:
- A possible recorded lecture on VCF Files from the 6150 class 
- Need access TeraLab
- Understand VCF File
- In lab server, find Codigo dataset, create a subset of that dataset that can be used for analysis for medical samples
- Ask Jordan what subset he wants (what variants he wants and what samples he wants from Codigo dataset)
